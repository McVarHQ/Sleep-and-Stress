# Sleep-and-Stress
My first IoT Project

This uses Mediapipe to detect the structures from camera feed.
Using the points and angles we determine and classify it into different positions.

Work in Progress:
It has been done for 2 positions now. Log and Foetus. It will be expanded further
We associate different positions with their corresponding stress levels
We run it for a given time and collect all data and then save a overall stress report.
